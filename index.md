The CBER Crafting the Cryptoeconomy (CtCe) Conference is an event to educate attendees on the most recent developments in the cryptoeconomy. <b>In tandem with this conference, the CBER Forum will be releasing a call for research grants, sponsored by the Uniswap Foundation, where winning grant applications can receive upto $50,000 of funding over the following year.</b> Research grant applications are not intended to be onerous; rather, applicants need to submit only a single document with a well-posed and current research question along with a baseline well-defined research methodology. The portal for submissions of grant applications will be posted at <a href="https://www.cber-forum.org" target="_blank">www.cber-forum.org</a> on October 27th 2024, directly after the CBER CtCe Conference. Participation in the CBER CtCe conference is highly encouraged for grant applicants.
